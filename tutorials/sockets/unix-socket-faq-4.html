<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 How come I get "address already in use" from bind()? </A></H2>

<P>You get this when the address is already in use.  (Oh, you figured that 
much out?)  The most common reason for this is that you have stopped your 
server, and then re-started it right away.  The sockets that were used by 
the first incarnation of the server are still active.  This is further 
explained in 
<A HREF="unix-socket-faq-2.html#time_wait">2.7 Please explain the TIME_WAIT state.</A>, and
<A HREF="unix-socket-faq-2.html#close">2.5 How do I properly close a socket?</A>.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Why don't my sockets close?</A></H2>

<P>When you issue the <CODE>close()</CODE> system call, you are closing your 
interface to 
the socket, not the socket itself.  It is up to the kernel to close the 
socket.  Sometimes, for really technical reasons, the socket is kept 
alive for a few minutes after you close it.  It is normal, for example 
for the socket to go into a TIME_WAIT state, on the server side, for a 
few minutes.  People have reported ranges from 20 seconds to 4 minutes 
to me.  The official standard says that it should be 4 minutes.  On my 
Linux system it is about 2 minutes.  This is explained in great detail in 
<A HREF="unix-socket-faq-2.html#time_wait">2.7 Please explain the TIME_WAIT state.</A>.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 How can I make my server a daemon?</A></H2>

<P>There are two approaches you can take here.  The first is to use inetd to 
do all the hard work for you.  The second is to do all the hard work 
yourself.</P>
<P>If you use inetd, you simply use <CODE>stdin</CODE>, <CODE>stdout</CODE>, or <CODE>stderr</CODE> for 
your 
socket.  (These three are all created with <CODE>dup()</CODE> from the real socket)  
You can use these as you would a socket in your code.  The inetd process 
will even close the socket for you when you are done.</P>
<P>If you wish to write your own server, there is a detailed explanation in 
"Unix Network Programming" by Richard Stevens (see
<A HREF="unix-socket-faq-1.html#books">1.6 Where can I get source code for the book [book  title]?</A>). I also 
picked up this 
posting from comp.unix.programmer, by Nikhil Nair 
(
<A HREF="mailto:nn201@cus.cam.ac.uk">nn201@cus.cam.ac.uk</A>).
You may want to add code to ignore SIGPIPE, because if this signal is
not dealt with, it will cause your application to exit.  (Thanks to

<H2><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4 How can I listen on more than one port at a time?</A></H2>

<P>The best way to do this is with the <CODE>select()</CODE> call.  This tells the 
kernel 
to let you know when a socket is available for use.  You can have one 
process do i/o with multiple sockets with this call.  If you want to wait 
for a connect on sockets 4, 6 and 10 you might execute the following code 
snippet:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
fd_set socklist;

FD_ZERO(&amp;socklist); /* Always clear the structure first. */
FD_SET(4, &amp;socklist);
FD_SET(6, &amp;socklist);
FD_SET(10, &amp;socklist);
if (select(11, NULL, &amp;socklist, NULL, NULL) &lt; 0)
  perror(&quot;select&quot;);
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The kernel will notify us as soon as a file descriptor which is less than 
11 (the first parameter to <CODE>select()</CODE>), and is a member of our 
<CODE>socklist</CODE> becomes 
available for writing.  See the man page on <CODE>select()</CODE> for more details.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss4.5">4.5 What exactly does SO_REUSEADDR do?</A></H2>

<P>This socket option tells the kernel that even if this port is busy (in
the TIME_WAIT state), go ahead and reuse it anyway.  If it is busy, but 
with another state, you will still get an address already in use error.
It is useful if your server has been shut down, and then restarted right 
away while sockets are still active on its port.  You should be aware 
that if any unexpected data comes in, it may confuse your server, but 
while this is possible, it is not likely. </P>
<P>It has been pointed out that "A socket is a 5 tuple (proto, local addr,
local port, remote addr, remote port).  SO_REUSEADDR just says that you
can reuse local addresses.  The 5 tuple still must be unique!" by Michael 
Hunter (mphunter@qnx.com).  This is true, and this is why it is very 
unlikely that unexpected data will ever be seen by your server.  The 
danger is that such a 5 tuple is still floating around on the net, and 
while it is bouncing around, a new connection from the same client, on 
the same system, happens to get the same remote port.  This is explained 
by Richard Stevens in 
<A HREF="unix-socket-faq-2.html#time_wait">2.7 Please explain the TIME_WAIT state.</A>.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss4.6">4.6 What exactly does SO_LINGER do?</A></H2>

<P>On some unixes this does nothing.  On others, it instructs the kernel to 
abort tcp connections instead of closing them properly.  This can be 
dangerous.  If you are not clear on this, see 
<A HREF="unix-socket-faq-2.html#time_wait">2.7 Please explain the TIME_WAIT state.</A>.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss4.7">4.7 What exactly does SO_KEEPALIVE do?</A></H2>

<P>From Andrew Gierth 
(
<A HREF="mailto:andrew@erlenstar.demon.co.uk">andrew@erlenstar.demon.co.uk</A>):</P>
<P>The <CODE>SO_KEEPALIVE</CODE> option causes a packet (called a 'keepalive probe') 
to be
sent to the remote system if a long time (by default, more than 2 hours)
passes with no other data being sent or received. This packet is designed to
provoke an ACK response from the peer. This enables detection of a peer
which has become unreachable (e.g. powered off or disconnected from the net).
See 
<A HREF="unix-socket-faq-2.html#peer_death">2.8 Why does it take so long to detect that the peer died?</A>
for further discussion.</P>
<P>Note that the figure of 2 hours comes from RFC1122, "Requirements for
Internet Hosts". The precise value should be configurable, but I've often
found this to be difficult.  The only implementation I know of that 
allows the keepalive interval to be set per-connection is SVR4.2.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss4.8">4.8 How can I bind() to a port number < 1024?</A></H2>

<P>From Andrew Gierth 
(
<A HREF="mailto:andrew@erlenstar.demon.co.uk">andrew@erlenstar.demon.co.uk</A>):</P>
<P>The restriction on access to ports < 1024 is part of a (fairly weak)
security scheme particular to UNIX. The intention is that servers (for
example rlogind, rshd) can check the port number of the client, and if it
is < 1024, assume the request has been properly authorised at the client
end.</P>
<P>The practical upshot of this, is that binding a port number < 1024 is
reserved to processes having an effective UID == root.</P>
<P>This can, occasionally, itself present a security problem, e.g. when a
server process needs to bind a well-known port, but does <EM>not</EM> itself need
root access (news servers, for example). This is often solved by creating
a small program which simply binds the socket, then restores the real userid
and <CODE>exec()</CODE>s the real server. This program can then be made setuid root.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss4.9">4.9 How do I get my server to find out the client's address / hostname?</A></H2>

<P>From Andrew Gierth 
(
<A HREF="mailto:andrew@erlenstar.demon.co.uk">andrew@erlenstar.demon.co.uk</A>):</P>
<P>After <CODE>accept()</CODE>ing a connection, use <CODE>getpeername()</CODE> to get the
address of the client.
The client's address is of
course, also returned on the <CODE>accept()</CODE>, but it is essential to
initialise the address-length parameter before the accept call for this
will work. </P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.10">4.10 How should I choose a port number for my server?</A></H2>

<P>The list of registered port assignments can be found in STD 2 or RFC 1700. 
Choose one that isn't already registered, and isn't in /etc/services on
your system.  It is also a good idea to let users customize the port
number in case of conflicts with other un-registered port numbers in other
servers.  The best way of doing this is hardcoding a service name, and 
using <CODE>getservbyname()</CODE> to lookup the actual port number.  This method 
allows users to change the port your server binds to by simply editing 
the /etc/services file.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss4.11">4.11 What is the difference between SO_REUSEADDR and SO_REUSEPORT?</A></H2>

<P><CODE>SO_REUSEADDR</CODE> allows your server to bind to an address which is in a
TIME_WAIT state.  It does not allow more than one server to bind to the
same address.  It was mentioned that use of this flag can create a
security risk because another server can bind to a the same port, by
binding to a specific address as opposed to <CODE>INADDR_ANY</CODE>.  The 
<CODE>SO_REUSEPORT</CODE>
flag allows multiple processes to bind to the same address provided all of
them use the <CODE>SO_REUSEPORT</CODE> option.  </P>
<P>From Richard Stevens 
(
<A HREF="mailto:rstevens@noao.edu">rstevens@noao.edu</A>):</P>
<P>This is a newer flag that appeared in the 4.4BSD multicasting code
(although that code was from elsewhere, so I am not sure just who
invented the new <CODE>SO_REUSEPORT</CODE> flag).</P>
<P>What this flag lets you do is rebind a port that is already in use,
but only if all users of the port specify the flag.  I believe the
intent is for multicasting apps, since if you're running the same
app on a host, all need to bind the same port.  But the flag may have
other uses.  For example the following is from a post in February:</P>
<P>From Stu Friedberg 
(
<A HREF="mailto:stuartf@sequent.com">stuartf@sequent.com</A>):</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<CODE>SO_REUSEPORT</CODE> is also useful for eliminating the try-10-times-to-bind
hack in ftpd's data connection setup routine.  Without <CODE>SO_REUSEPORT</CODE>,
only one ftpd thread can bind to TCP (lhost, lport, <CODE>INADDR_ANY</CODE>, 0) in
preparation for connecting back to the client.  Under conditions of
heavy load, there are more threads colliding here than the try-10-times
hack can accomodate.  With <CODE>SO_REUSEPORT</CODE>, things work nicely and the
hack becomes unnecessary.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>I have also heard that DEC OSF supports the flag.  Also note that under
4.4BSD, if you are binding a multicast address, then <CODE>SO_REUSEADDR</CODE> is
condisered the same as <CODE>SO_REUSEPORT</CODE> (p. 731 of "TCP/IP Illustrated,
Volume 2").  I think under Solaris you just replace <CODE>SO_REUSEPORT</CODE> with
<CODE>SO_REUSEADDR</CODE>.</P>
<P>From a later Stevens posting, with minor editing:</P>
<P>Basically <CODE>SO_REUSEPORT</CODE> is a BSD'ism that arose when multicasting was added,
even thought it was not used in the original Steve Deering code.  I
believe some BSD-derived systems may also include it (OSF, now Digital
Unix, perhaps?).  <CODE>SO_REUSEPORT</CODE> lets you bind the same address *and* port,
but only if all the binders have specified it.  But when binding a
multicast address (its main use), <CODE>SO_REUSEADDR</CODE> is considered identical
to <CODE>SO_REUSEPORT</CODE> (p. 731, "TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 2").  
So for portability of multicasting applications
I always use <CODE>SO_REUSEADDR</CODE>.</P>


<H2><A NAME="multi-homed"></A> <A NAME="ss4.12">4.12 How can I write a multi-homed server?</A></H2>

<P>The original question was actually from Shankar Ramamoorthy
(
<A HREF="mailto:shankar@viman.com">shankar@viman.com</A>):</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<EM>I want to run a server on a multi-homed host. The host is part of
two networks and has two ethernet cards. I want to run a server on
this machine, binding to a pre-determined port number. I want 
clients on either subnet to be able to send broadcast packates to
the port and have the server receive them.</EM>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>And answered by Andrew Gierth 
(
<A HREF="mailto:andrew@erlenstar.demon.co.uk">andrew@erlenstar.demon.co.uk</A>):</P>
<P>Your first question in this scenario is, do you need to know which
subnet the packet came from? I'm not at all sure that this can be
reliably determined in all cases.</P>
<P>If you don't really care, then all you need is one socket bound to
<CODE>INADDR_ANY</CODE>. That simplifies things greatly.</P>
<P>If you <EM>do</EM> care, then you have to bind multiple sockets. You are
obviously attempting to do this in your code as posted, so I'll
assume you do.</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<EM>I was hoping that something like the following would work. Will it?
This is on Sparcs running Solaris 2.4/2.5.</EM>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>I don't have access to Solaris, but I'll comment based on my experience
with other Unixes.</P>
<P>[Shankar's original code omitted]</P>
<P>What you are doing is attempting to bind all the current hosts unicast
addresses as listed in hosts/NIS/DNS. This may or may not reflect
reality, but much more importantly, neglects the broadcast addresses.
It seems to be the case in the majority of implementations that a socket
bound to a unicast address will <EM>not</EM> see incoming packets with broadcast
addresses as their destinations.</P>
<P>The approach I've taken is to use <CODE>SIOCGIFCONF</CODE> to retrieve the list of
active network interfaces, and <CODE>SIOCGIFFLAGS</CODE> and <CODE>SIOCGIFBRDADDR</CODE>
to identify broadcastable interfaces and get the broadcast addresses.
Then I bind to each unicast address, each broadcast address, <EM>and to</EM>
<CODE>INADDR_ANY</CODE> <EM>as well</EM>. That last is necessary to catch packets 
that are
on the wire with <CODE>INADDR_BROADCAST</CODE> in the destination. 
(<CODE>SO_REUSEADDR</CODE> is
necessary to bind <CODE>INADDR_ANY</CODE> as well as the specific addresses.)</P>
<P>This gives me very nearly what I want. The wrinkles are:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>I don't assume that getting a packet through a particular socket
necessarily means that it actually arrived on that interface.</LI>
<LI>I can't tell anything about which subnet a packet originated on 
if its destination was INADDR_BROADCAST.</LI>
<LI>On some stacks, apparently only those with multicast support, I
get duplicate incoming messages on the INADDR_ANY socket.</LI>
</UL>
</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss4.13">4.13 How can I read only one character at a time?</A></H2>

<P>This question is usually asked by people who are testing their
server with telnet, and want it to process their keystrokes one
character at a time.  The correct technique is to use a psuedo
terminal (pty).  More on that in a minute.</P>
<P>According to Roger Espel Llima
(
<A HREF="mailto:espel@drakkar.ens.fr">espel@drakkar.ens.fr</A>), you can have
your server send a sequence of control characters: <CODE>0xff 0xfb 0x01 0xff 0xfb 0x03 0xff 0xfd 0x0f3</CODE>, which
translates to <CODE>IAC WILL ECHO IAC WILL SUPPRESS-GO-AHEAD IAC DO
SUPPRESS-GO-AHEAD</CODE>.  For more information on what this
means, check out std8, std28 and std29.  Roger also gave the
following tips:
<UL>
<LI>This code will suppress echo, so you'll have to send the
characters the user types back to the client if you want the
user to see them.</LI>
<LI>Carriage returns will be followed by a null character, so
you'll have to expect them.</LI>
<LI>If you get a <CODE>0xff</CODE>, it will be followed by two more characters.
These are telnet escapes.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Use of a pty would also be the correct way to execute a child
process and pass the i/o to a socket.</P>
<P>I'll add pty stuff to the list of example source I'd like to add
to the faq.  If someone has some source they'd like to contribute
(without copyright) to the faq which demonstrates use of pty's,
please email me!</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss4.14">4.14 I'm trying to exec() a program from my server, and attach my socket's IO to it, but I'm not getting all the data across.  Why?</A></H2>

<P>If the program you are running uses <CODE>printf()</CODE>, etc (streams from 
<CODE>stdio.h</CODE>) you have to deal with two buffers.  The kernel buffers all 
socket IO, and this is explained in 
<A HREF="unix-socket-faq-2.html#flush">section 2.11</A>.
The second buffer is the one that is causing you grief.  This is the 
stdio buffer, and the problem was well explained by Andrew:</P>
<P>(The short answer to this question is that you want to use a pty
rather than a socket; the remainder of this article is an attempt
to explain why.)</P>
<P>Firstly, the socket buffer controlled by <CODE>setsockopt()</CODE> has <EM>absolutly
nothing</EM> to do with stdio buffering. Setting it to 1 is guaranteed to
be the Wrong Thing(tm).</P>
<P>Perhaps the following diagram might make things a little clearer:</P>

relevent), you can see that data written by process A to its stdio
buffer is completely inaccessible to process B. Only once the decision
is made to flush that buffer to the kernel (via <CODE>write()</CODE>) can the data
actually be delivered to the other process.</P>
<P>The only guaranteed way to affect the buffering within process A is to
change the code. However, the default buffering for stdout is controlled
by whether the underlying FD refers to a terminal or not; generally,
output to terminals is line-buffered, and output to non-terminals
(including but not limited to files, pipes, sockets, non-tty devices,
etc.) is fully buffered. So the desired effect can usually be achieved
by using a pty device; this, for example, is what the 'expect' program
does.</P>
<P>Since the stdio buffer (and the <CODE>FILE</CODE> structure, and everything else
related to stdio) is user-level data, it is not preserved across an
<CODE>exec()</CODE> call, hence trying to use <CODE>setvbuf()</CODE> before the exec is
ineffective.</P>
<P>A couple of alternate solutions were proposed by Roger Espel Llima
(
<A HREF="mailto:espel@drakkar.ens.fr">espel@drakkar.ens.fr</A>):</P>
<P>If it's an option,
you can use some standalone program that will just run something inside
a pty and buffer its input/output.  I've seen a package by the name
pty.tar.gz that did that; you could search around for it with archie or
AltaVista.</P>
<P>Another option (<EM>**warning, evil hack**</EM>) , if you're on a system that
supports this (SunOS, Solaris, Linux ELF do; I don't know about others)
is to, on your main program, <CODE>putenv()</CODE> the name of a shared executable
(*.so)  in LD_PRELOAD, and then in that .so redefine some commonly used
libc function that the program you're exec'ing is known to use early.
There you can 'get control' on the running program, and the first time
you get it, do a <CODE>setbuf(stdout, NULL)</CODE> on the program's behalf, and then
call the original libc function with a <CODE>dlopen()</CODE> + <CODE>dlsym()</CODE>.  And 
you keep the <CODE>dlsym()</CODE> value on a static var, so you can just call 
that the following times.</P>
<P><EM>(Editors note:  I still haven't done an expample for how to do pty's, 
but I hope I will be able to do one after I finish the non-blocking 
example code.)</EM></P>
