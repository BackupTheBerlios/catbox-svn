<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 How do I convert a string into an internet address?</A></H2>

<P>If you are reading a host's address from the command line, you may not 
know if you have an aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd style address, or a host.domain.com 
style address.  What I do with these, is first try to use it as a 
aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd type address, and if that fails, then do a name lookup on 
it.  Here is an example:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
/* Converts ascii text to in_addr struct.  NULL is returned if the 
   address can not be found. */
struct in_addr *atoaddr(char *address) {
  struct hostent *host;
  static struct in_addr saddr;

  /* First try it as aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd. */
  saddr.s_addr = inet_addr(address);
  if (saddr.s_addr != -1) {
    return &amp;saddr;
  }
  host = gethostbyname(address);
  if (host != NULL) {
    return (struct in_addr *) *host-&gt;h_addr_list;
  }
  return NULL;
}

<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 How can my client work through a firewall/proxy server?</A></H2>

<P>If you are running through separate proxies for each service, you 
shouldn't
need to do anything.  If you are working through sockd, you will need to
"socksify" your application.  Details for doing this can be found in the
package itself, which is available at:</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Why does connect() succeed even before my server did an accept()?</A></H2>

<P>From Andrew Gierth 
(
<A HREF="mailto:andrew@erlenstar.demon.co.uk">andrew@erlenstar.demon.co.uk</A>):</P>
<P>Once you have done a <CODE>listen()</CODE> call on your socket, the kernel is 
primed to
accept connections on it. The usual UNIX implementation of this works by
<EM>immediately</EM> completing the SYN handshake for any incoming valid SYN
segments (connection attempts), creating the socket for the new connection,
and keeping this new socket on an internal queue ready for the <CODE>accept()</CODE>
call. So the socket is fully open <EM>before</EM> the accept is done.</P>
<P>The other factor in this is the 'backlog' parameter for <CODE>listen()</CODE>; that
defines how many of these completed connections can be queued at one time.
If the specified number is exceeded, then new incoming connects are simply
ignored (which causes them to be retried).</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 Why do I sometimes lose a server's address when using more than one server? </A></H2>

<P>From Andrew Gierth 
(
<A HREF="mailto:andrew@erlenstar.demon.co.uk">andrew@erlenstar.demon.co.uk</A>):</P>
<P>Take a careful look at struct hostent. Notice that almost everything
in it is a pointer? <EM>All</EM> these pointers will refer to statically
allocated data.</P>
<P>For example, if you do:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
    struct hostent *host = gethostbyname(hostname);
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>then (as you should know) a subsequent call to <CODE>gethostbyname()</CODE> will
overwrite the structure pointed to by 'host'.</P>
<P>But if you do:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
    struct hostent myhost;
    struct hostent *hostptr = gethostbyname(hostname);
    if (hostptr) myhost = *host;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>to make a copy of the <CODE>hostent</CODE> before it gets overwritten, then it 
<EM>still</EM>
gets clobbered by a subsequent call to <CODE>gethostbyname()</CODE>, since although
<CODE>myhost</CODE> won't get overwritten, all the data it is pointing to 
will be. </P>
<P>You can get round this by doing a proper 'deep copy' of the <CODE>hostent</CODE>
structure, but this is tedious. My recommendation would be to extract
the needed fields of the <CODE>hostent</CODE> and store them in your own way.</P>
<P>Robin Paterson
(
<A HREF="mailto:etmrpat@etm.ericsson.se">etmrpat@etm.ericsson.se</A>) has added:</P>
<P>It might be nice if you mention MT safe libraries provide complimentary 
functions for multithreaded programming.  On the solaris machine 
I'm typing at, we have <CODE>gethostbyname</CODE> and <CODE>gethostbyname_r</CODE>
(<CODE>_r</CODE> for reentrant).
The main difference is, <EM>you</EM> provide the storage for the hostent 
struct so you always have a local copy and not just a pointer to the 
static copy.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss3.5">3.5 How can I set the timeout for the connect() system call?</A></H2>

<P>From Richard Stevens 
(
<A HREF="mailto:rstevens@noao.edu">rstevens@noao.edu</A>):</P>
<P>Normally you cannot change this.  Solaris does let you do this, on a
per-kernel basis with the ndd <CODE>tcp_ip_abort_cinterval</CODE> parameter.</P>
<P>The easiest way to shorten the connect time is with an <CODE>alarm()</CODE> around
the call to <CODE>connect()</CODE>.  A harder way is to use <CODE>select()</CODE>, after 
setting the socket nonblocking.  Also notice that you can only shorten the
connect time, there's normally no way to lengthen it.</P>
<P>From Andrew Gierth 
(
<A HREF="mailto:andrew@erlenstar.demon.co.uk">andrew@erlenstar.demon.co.uk</A>):</P>
<P>First, create the socket and put it into non-blocking mode, then call
connect(). There are three possibilities:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>connect succeeds: the connection has been successfully made (this
usually only happens when connecting to the same machine)</LI>
<LI>connect fails: obvious</LI>
<LI>connect returns -1/EINPROGRESS. The connection attempt has begun,
but not yet completed.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>If the connection succeeds:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>the socket will select() as writable (and will also select as readable
if data arrives)</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>If the connection fails:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>the socket will select as readable *and* writable, but either a read 
or write will return the error code from the connection attempt. Also,
you can use getsockopt(SO_ERROR) to get the error status - but be 
careful; some systems return the error code in the result parameter of 
getsockopt, but others (incorrectly) cause the getsockopt call *itself*
to fail with the stored value as the error.</LI>
</UL>
</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss3.6">3.6 Should I bind() a port number in my client program, or let the</A>system choose one for me on the connect() call?</H2>

<P>From Andrew Gierth 
(
<A HREF="mailto:andrew@erlenstar.demon.co.uk">andrew@erlenstar.demon.co.uk</A>):</P>
<P><B>** Let the system choose your client's port number **</B></P>
<P>The exception to this, is if the server has been written to be picky about
what client ports it will allow connections from. Rlogind and rshd are the
classic examples. This is usually part of a Unix-specific (and rather weak)
authentication scheme; the intent is that the server allows connections only
from processes with root privilege. (The weakness in the scheme is that many
O/Ss (e.g. MS-DOS) allow anyone to bind any port.)</P>
<P>The <CODE>rresvport()</CODE> routine exists to help out clients that are using this
scheme. It basically does the equivalent of <CODE>socket()</CODE> + <CODE>bind()</CODE>, 
choosing a port number in the range 512..1023.</P>
<P>If the server is not fussy about the <EM>client's</EM> port number, then 
don't try
and assign it yourself in the client, just let <CODE>connect()</CODE> pick it for 
you.</P>
<P>If, in a client, you use the naive scheme of starting at a fixed port number
and calling <CODE>bind()</CODE> on consecutive values until it works, then you buy
yourself a whole lot of trouble:</P>
<P>The problem is if the server end of your connection does an active close.
(E.G. client sends 'QUIT' command to server, server responds by closing the
connection). That leaves the client end of the connection in CLOSED state,
and the server end in TIME_WAIT state. So after the client exits, there is
no trace of the connection on the client end.</P>
<P>Now run the client again. It will pick the same port number, since as far as
it can see, it's free. But as soon as it calls <CODE>connect()</CODE>, the server 
finds
that you are trying to duplicate an existing connection (although one in
TIME_WAIT). It is perfectly entitled to refuse to do this, so you get, I
suspect, <CODE>ECONNREFUSED</CODE> from <CODE>connect()</CODE>. (Some systems may sometimes 
allow the connection anyway, but you <EM>can't</EM> rely on it.)</P>
<P>This problem is <EM>especially</EM> dangerous because it doesn't show up 
unless the
client and server are on <EM>different</EM> machines. (If they are the same 
machine,
then the client <EM>won't</EM> pick the same port number as before). So you 
can get
bitten well into the development cycle (if you do what I suspect most people
do, and test client &amp; server on the same box initially).</P>
<P>Even if your protocol has the client closing first, there are still ways to
produce this problem (e.g. kill the server).</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss3.7">3.7 Why do I get "connection refused" when the server isn't running?</A></H2>

<P>The <CODE>connect()</CODE> call will only block while it is waiting to establish a
connection.  When there is no server waiting at the other end, it gets
notified that the connection can not be established, and gives up with the
error message you see.  This is a good thing, since if it were not the
case clients might wait for ever for a service which just doesn't exist. 
Users would think that they were only waiting for the connection to be
established, and then after a while give up, muttering something about
crummy software under their breath. </P>


<H2><A NAME="ss3.8">3.8 What does one do when one does not know how much information is comming</A>over the socket ? Is there a way to have a dynamic buffer ?</H2>

<P>This question asked by Niranjan Perera
(
<A HREF="mailto:perera@mindspring.com">perera@mindspring.com</A>).</P>
<P>When the size of the incoming data is unknown, you can either make the
size of the buffer as big as the largest possible (or likely) buffer, or
you can re-size the buffer on the fly during your read.  When you 
<CODE>malloc()</CODE>
a large buffer, most (if not all) varients of unix will only allocate
address space, but not physical pages of ram.  As more and more of the
buffer is used, the kernel allocates physical memory.  This means that
malloc'ing a large buffer will not waste resources unless that memory is
used, and so it is perfectly acceptable to ask for a meg of ram when you
expect only a few K.</P>
<P>On the other hand, a more elegant solution that does not depend on the
inner workings of the kernel is to use realloc() to expand the buffer as
required in say 4K chunks (since 4K is the size of a page of ram on most
systems).  I may add something like this to sockhelp.c in the example
code one day.</P>
