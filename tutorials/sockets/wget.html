GNU Wget is a freely available network utility to retrieve files from
the World Wide Web, using HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) and
FTP (File Transfer Protocol), the two most widely used Internet
protocols.  It has many useful features to make downloading easier, some
of them being:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Wget is non-interactive, meaning that it can work in the background,
while the user is not logged on.  This allows you to start a retrieval
and disconnect from the system, letting Wget finish the work.  By
contrast, most of the Web browsers require constant user's presence,
which can be a great hindrance when transferring a lot of data.

<P>
<LI>

Wget is capable of descending recursively through the structure of
HTML documents and FTP directory trees, making a local copy of
the directory hierarchy similar to the one on the remote server.  This
feature can be used to mirror archives and home pages, or traverse the
web in search of data, like a WWW robot (See section <A HREF="wget.html#SEC43">Robots</A>).  In that
spirit, Wget understands the <CODE>norobots</CODE> convention.

<P>
<LI>

File name wildcard matching and recursive mirroring of directories are
available when retrieving via FTP.  Wget can read the time-stamp
information given by both HTTP and FTP servers, and store it
locally.  Thus Wget can see if the remote file has changed since last
retrieval, and automatically retrieve the new version if it has.  This
makes Wget suitable for mirroring of FTP sites, as well as home
pages.

<P>
<LI>

Wget works exceedingly well on slow or unstable connections, 
retrying the document until it is fully retrieved, or until a
user-specified retry count is surpassed.  It will try to resume the
download from the point of interruption, using <CODE>REST</CODE> with FTP
and <CODE>Range</CODE> with HTTP servers that support them.

<P>
<LI>

By default, Wget supports proxy servers, which can lighten the network
load, speed up retrieval and provide access behind firewalls.  However,
if you are behind a firewall that requires that you use a socks style
gateway, you can get the socks library and build wget with support for
socks.  Wget also supports the passive FTP downloading as an
option.

<P>
<LI>

Builtin features offer mechanisms to tune which links you wish to follow
(See section <A HREF="wget.html#SEC14">Following Links</A>).

<P>
<LI>

The retrieval is conveniently traced with printing dots, each dot
representing a fixed amount of data received (1KB by default).  These
representations can be customized to your preferences.

<P>
<LI>

Most of the features are fully configurable, either through command line
options, or via the initialization file <TT>`.wgetrc'</TT> (See section <A HREF="wget.html#SEC26">Startup File</A>).  Wget allows you to define <EM>global</EM> startup files
(<TT>`/usr/local/etc/wgetrc'</TT> by default) for site settings.

<P>
<LI>

Finally, GNU Wget is free software.  This means that everyone may use
it, redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General
Public License, as published by the Free Software Foundation
(See section <A HREF="wget.html#SEC51">GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</A>).

<A NAME="IDX4"></A>
<A NAME="IDX5"></A>
<A NAME="IDX6"></A>

</P>
<P>
By default, Wget is very simple to invoke.  The basic syntax is:

</P>

<PRE>
wget [<VAR>option</VAR>]... [<VAR>URL</VAR>]...
</PRE>

<P>
Wget will simply download all the URLs specified on the command
line.  <VAR>URL</VAR> is a <EM>Uniform Resource Locator</EM>, as defined below.

</P>
<P>
However, you may wish to change some of the default parameters of
Wget.  You can do it two ways: permanently, adding the appropriate
command to <TT>`.wgetrc'</TT> (See section <A HREF="wget.html#SEC26">Startup File</A>), or specifying it on
the command line.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="wget.html#TOC3">URL Format</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX7"></A>
<A NAME="IDX8"></A>

</P>
<P>
<EM>URL</EM> is an acronym for Uniform Resource Locator.  A uniform
resource locator is a compact string representation for a resource
available via the Internet.  Wget recognizes the URL syntax as per
RFC1738.  This is the most widely used form (square brackets denote
optional parts):

</P>

<PRE>
http://host[:port]/directory/file
ftp://host[:port]/directory/file
</PRE>

<P>
You can also encode your username and password within a URL:

</P>

<PRE>
ftp://user:password@host/path
http://user:password@host/path
</PRE>

<P>
Either <VAR>user</VAR> or <VAR>password</VAR>, or both, may be left out.  If you
leave out either the HTTP username or password, no authentication
will be sent.  If you leave out the FTP username, <SAMP>`anonymous'</SAMP>
will be used.  If you leave out the FTP password, your email
address will be supplied as a default password.<A NAME="DOCF1" HREF="wget.html#FOOT1">(1)</A>

</P>
<P>
You can encode unsafe characters in a URL as <SAMP>`%xy'</SAMP>, <CODE>xy</CODE>
being the hexadecimal representation of the character's ASCII
value.  Some common unsafe characters include <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> (quoted as
<SAMP>`%25'</SAMP>), <SAMP>`:'</SAMP> (quoted as <SAMP>`%3A'</SAMP>), and <SAMP>`@'</SAMP> (quoted as
<SAMP>`%40'</SAMP>).  Refer to RFC1738 for a comprehensive list of unsafe
characters.

</P>
<P>
Wget also supports the <CODE>type</CODE> feature for FTP URLs.  By
default, FTP documents are retrieved in the binary mode (type
<SAMP>`i'</SAMP>), which means that they are downloaded unchanged.  Another
useful mode is the <SAMP>`a'</SAMP> (<EM>ASCII</EM>) mode, which converts the line
delimiters between the different operating systems, and is thus useful
for text files.  Here is an example:

</P>

<PRE>
ftp://host/directory/file;type=a
</PRE>

<P>
Two alternative variants of URL specification are also supported,
because of historical (hysterical?) reasons and their wide-spreadedness.

</P>
<P>
FTP-only syntax (supported by <CODE>NcFTP</CODE>):

<PRE>
host:/dir/file
</PRE>

<P>
HTTP-only syntax (introduced by <CODE>Netscape</CODE>):

<PRE>
host[:port]/dir/file
</PRE>

<P>
These two alternative forms are deprecated, and may cease being
supported in the future.

</P>
<P>
If you do not understand the difference between these notations, or do
not know which one to use, just use the plain ordinary format you use
with your favorite browser, like <CODE>Lynx</CODE> or <CODE>Netscape</CODE>.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC4" HREF="wget.html#TOC4">Option Syntax</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX9"></A>
<A NAME="IDX10"></A>

</P>
<P>
Since Wget uses GNU getopts to process its arguments, every option has a
short form and a long form.  Long options are more convenient to
remember, but take time to type.  You may freely mix different option
styles, or specify options after the command-line arguments. Thus you
may write:

</P>

<PRE>
wget -r --tries=10 http://fly.cc.fer.hr/ -o log
</PRE>

<P>
The space between the option accepting an argument and the argument may
be omitted.  Instead <SAMP>`-o log'</SAMP> you can write <SAMP>`-olog'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
You may put several options that do not require arguments together,
like:

</P>

<PRE>
wget -drc <VAR>URL</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
This is a complete equivalent of:

</P>

<PRE>
wget -d -r -c <VAR>URL</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
Since the options can be specified after the arguments, you may
terminate them with <SAMP>`--'</SAMP>.  So the following will try to download
URL <SAMP>`-x'</SAMP>, reporting failure to <TT>`log'</TT>:

</P>

<PRE>
wget -o log -- -x
</PRE>

<P>
The options that accept comma-separated lists all respect the convention
that specifying an empty list clears its value.  This can be useful to
clear the <TT>`.wgetrc'</TT> settings.  For instance, if your <TT>`.wgetrc'</TT>
sets <CODE>exclude_directories</CODE> to <TT>`/cgi-bin'</TT>, the following
example will first reset it, and then set it to exclude <TT>`/~nobody'</TT>
and <TT>`/~somebody'</TT>.  You can also clear the lists in <TT>`.wgetrc'</TT>
(See section <A HREF="wget.html#SEC28">Wgetrc Syntax</A>).

</P>

<PRE>
wget -X '' -X /~nobody,/~somebody
</PRE>

Log all messages to <VAR>logfile</VAR>.  The messages are normally reported
to standard error.

<A NAME="IDX14"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`-a <VAR>logfile</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`--append-output=<VAR>logfile</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>
Append to <VAR>logfile</VAR>.  This is the same as <SAMP>`-o'</SAMP>, only it appends
to <VAR>logfile</VAR> instead of overwriting the old log file.  If
<VAR>logfile</VAR> does not exist, a new file is created.

<A NAME="IDX15"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`-d'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`--debug'</SAMP>
<DD>
Turn on debug output, meaning various information important to the
developers of Wget if it does not work properly.  Your system
administrator may have chosen to compile Wget without debug support, in
which case <SAMP>`-d'</SAMP> will not work.  Please note that compiling with
debug support is always safe--Wget compiled with the debug support will
<EM>not</EM> print any debug info unless requested with <SAMP>`-d'</SAMP>.
See section <A HREF="wget.html#SEC39">Reporting Bugs</A> for more information on how to use <SAMP>`-d'</SAMP> for
sending bug reports.

<A NAME="IDX16"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`-q'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`--quiet'</SAMP>
<DD>
Turn off Wget's output.

<A NAME="IDX17"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`-v'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`--verbose'</SAMP>
<DD>
Turn on verbose output, with all the available data.  The default output
is verbose.

<DT><SAMP>`-nv'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`--non-verbose'</SAMP>
<DD>
Non-verbose output--turn off verbose without being completely quiet
(use <SAMP>`-q'</SAMP> for that), which means that error messages and basic
information still get printed.

<A NAME="IDX18"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`-i <VAR>file</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`--input-file=<VAR>file</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>
Read URLs from <VAR>file</VAR>, in which case no URLs need to be on
the command line.  If there are URLs both on the command line and
in an input file, those on the command lines will be the first ones to
be retrieved.  The <VAR>file</VAR> need not be an HTML document (but no
harm if it is)---it is enough if the URLs are just listed
sequentially.

However, if you specify <SAMP>`--force-html'</SAMP>, the document will be
regarded as <SAMP>`html'</SAMP>.  In that case you may have problems with
relative links, which you can solve either by adding <CODE>&#60;base
href="<VAR>url</VAR>"&#62;</CODE> to the documents or by specifying
<SAMP>`--base=<VAR>url</VAR>'</SAMP> on the command line.

<A NAME="IDX19"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`-F'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`--force-html'</SAMP>
<DD>
When input is read from a file, force it to be treated as an HTML
file.  This enables you to retrieve relative links from existing
HTML files on your local disk, by adding <CODE>&#60;base
href="<VAR>url</VAR>"&#62;</CODE> to HTML, or using the <SAMP>`--base'</SAMP> command-line
option.
</DL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="wget.html#TOC7">Download Options</A></H2>

<A NAME="IDX20"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX21"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX22"></A>
 
<DT><SAMP>`--tries=<VAR>number</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>
Set number of retries to <VAR>number</VAR>.  Specify 0 or <SAMP>`inf'</SAMP> for
infinite retrying.

<DT><SAMP>`-O <VAR>file</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`--output-document=<VAR>file</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>
The documents will not be written to the appropriate files, but all will
be concatenated together and written to <VAR>file</VAR>.  If <VAR>file</VAR>
already exists, it will be overwritten.  If the <VAR>file</VAR> is <SAMP>`-'</SAMP>,
the documents will be written to standard output.  Including this option
automatically sets the number of tries to 1.

<A NAME="IDX23"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`-nc'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`--no-clobber'</SAMP>
<DD>
Do not clobber existing files when saving to directory hierarchy within
recursive retrieval of several files. This option is <EM>extremely</EM>
useful when you wish to continue where you left off with retrieval of
many files.  If the files have the <SAMP>`.html'</SAMP> or (yuck) <SAMP>`.htm'</SAMP>
suffix, they will be loaded from the local disk, and parsed as if they
have been retrieved from the Web.

<A NAME="IDX24"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`-c'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`--continue'</SAMP>
<DD>
Continue getting an existing file.  This is useful when you want to
finish up the download started by another program, or a previous
instance of Wget.  Thus you can write:


<PRE>
wget -c ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/ls-lR.Z
</PRE>

If there is a file name <TT>`ls-lR.Z'</TT> in the current directory, Wget
will assume that it is the first portion of the remote file, and will
require the server to continue the retrieval from an offset equal to the
length of the local file.

Note that you need not specify this option if all you want is Wget to
continue retrieving where it left off when the connection is lost--Wget
does this by default.  You need this option only when you want to
continue retrieval of a file already halfway retrieved, saved by another
FTP client, or left by Wget being killed.

Without <SAMP>`-c'</SAMP>, the previous example would just begin to download the
remote file to <TT>`ls-lR.Z.1'</TT>.  The <SAMP>`-c'</SAMP> option is also
applicable for HTTP servers that support the <CODE>Range</CODE> header.

<A NAME="IDX25"></A>
<A NAME="IDX26"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`--dot-style=<VAR>style</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>
Set the retrieval style to <VAR>style</VAR>.  Wget traces the retrieval of
each document by printing dots on the screen, each dot representing a
fixed amount of retrieved data.  Any number of dots may be separated in
a <EM>cluster</EM>, to make counting easier.  This option allows you to
choose one of the pre-defined styles, determining the number of bytes
represented by a dot, the number of dots in a cluster, and the number of
dots on the line.

With the <CODE>default</CODE> style each dot represents 1K, there are ten dots
in a cluster and 50 dots in a line.  The <CODE>binary</CODE> style has a more
"computer"-like orientation--8K dots, 16-dots clusters and 48 dots
per line (which makes for 384K lines).  The <CODE>mega</CODE> style is
suitable for downloading very large files--each dot represents 64K
retrieved, there are eight dots in a cluster, and 48 dots on each line
(so each line contains 3M).  The <CODE>micro</CODE> style is exactly the
reverse; it is suitable for downloading small files, with 128-byte dots,
8 dots per cluster, and 48 dots (6K) per line.

<DT><SAMP>`-N'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`--timestamping'</SAMP>
<DD>
Turn on time-stamping.  See section <A HREF="wget.html#SEC22">Time-Stamping</A> for details.

<A NAME="IDX27"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`-S'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`--server-response'</SAMP>
<DD>
Print the headers sent by HTTP servers and responses sent by
FTP servers.

<A NAME="IDX28"></A>
<A NAME="IDX29"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`--spider'</SAMP>

When invoked with this option, Wget will behave as a Web <EM>spider</EM>,
which means that it will not download the pages, just check that they
are there.  You can use it to check your bookmarks, e.g. with:


<PRE>
wget --spider --force-html -i bookmarks.html
</PRE>

This feature needs much more work for Wget to get close to the
functionality of real WWW spiders.

<DT><SAMP>`-T seconds'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`--timeout=<VAR>seconds</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>
Set the read timeout to <VAR>seconds</VAR> seconds.  Whenever a network read
is issued, the file descriptor is checked for a timeout, which could
otherwise leave a pending connection (uninterrupted read).  The default
timeout is 900 seconds (fifteen minutes).  Setting timeout to 0 will
disable checking for timeouts.

Please do not lower the default timeout value with this option unless
you know what you are doing.

<A NAME="IDX32"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`-w <VAR>seconds</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`--wait=<VAR>seconds</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>
Wait the specified number of seconds between the retrievals.  Use of
this option is recommended, as it lightens the server load by making the
requests less frequent.  Instead of in seconds, the time can be
specified in minutes using the <CODE>m</CODE> suffix, in hours using <CODE>h</CODE>
suffix, or in days using <CODE>d</CODE> suffix.

Specifying a large value for this option is useful if the network or the
destination host is down, so that Wget can wait long enough to
reasonably expect the network error to be fixed before the retry.

<A NAME="IDX33"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`-Y on/off'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`--proxy=on/off'</SAMP>

Turn proxy support on or off. The proxy is on by default if the
appropriate environmental variable is defined.

<A NAME="IDX34"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`-Q <VAR>quota</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`--quota=<VAR>quota</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>
Specify download quota for automatic retrievals.  The value can be
specified in bytes (default), kilobytes (with <SAMP>`k'</SAMP> suffix), or
megabytes (with <SAMP>`m'</SAMP> suffix).

Note that quota will never affect downloading a single file.  So if you
specify <SAMP>`wget -Q10k ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/ls-lR.gz'</SAMP>, all of the
<TT>`ls-lR.gz'</TT> will be downloaded.  The same goes even when several
URLs are specified on the command-line.  However, quota is
respected when retrieving either recursively, or from an input file.
Thus you may safely type <SAMP>`wget -Q2m -i sites'</SAMP>---download will be
aborted when the quota is exceeded.

Setting quota to 0 or to <SAMP>`inf'</SAMP> unlimits the download quota.

<DT><SAMP>`-nd'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`--no-directories'</SAMP>
<DD>
Do not create a hierarchy of directories when retrieving
recursively. With this option turned on, all files will get saved to the
current directory, without clobbering (if a name shows up more than
once, the filenames will get extensions <SAMP>`.n'</SAMP>).

<DT><SAMP>`-x'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`--force-directories'</SAMP>
<DD>
The opposite of <SAMP>`-nd'</SAMP>---create a hierarchy of directories, even if
one would not have been created otherwise.  E.g. <SAMP>`wget -x
http://fly.cc.fer.hr/robots.txt'</SAMP> will save the downloaded file to
<TT>`fly.cc.fer.hr/robots.txt'</TT>.

<DT><SAMP>`-nH'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`--no-host-directories'</SAMP>
<DD>
Disable generation of host-prefixed directories.  By default, invoking
Wget with <SAMP>`-r http://fly.cc.fer.hr/'</SAMP> will create a structure of
directories beginning with <TT>`fly.cc.fer.hr/'</TT>.  This option disables
such behavior.

<A NAME="IDX35"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`--cut-dirs=<VAR>number</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>
Ignore <VAR>number</VAR> directory components.  This is useful for getting a
fine-grained control over the directory where recursive retrieval will
be saved.

Take, for example, the directory at
<SAMP>`ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/'</SAMP>.  If you retrieve it with
<SAMP>`-r'</SAMP>, it will be saved locally under
<TT>`ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/'</TT>.  While the <SAMP>`-nH'</SAMP> option can
remove the <TT>`ftp.xemacs.org/'</TT> part, you are still stuck with
<TT>`pub/xemacs'</TT>.  This is where <SAMP>`--cut-dirs'</SAMP> comes in handy; it
makes Wget not "see" <VAR>number</VAR> remote directory components.  Here
are several examples of how <SAMP>`--cut-dirs'</SAMP> option works.


<PRE>
No options        -&#62; ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/
-nH               -&#62; pub/xemacs/
-nH --cut-dirs=1  -&#62; xemacs/
-nH --cut-dirs=2  -&#62; .

--cut-dirs=1      -&#62; ftp.xemacs.org/xemacs/
...
</PRE>

If you just want to get rid of the directory structure, this option is
similar to a combination of <SAMP>`-nd'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-P'</SAMP>.  However, unlike
<SAMP>`-nd'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`--cut-dirs'</SAMP> does not lose with subdirectories--for
instance, with <SAMP>`-nH --cut-dirs=1'</SAMP>, a <TT>`beta/'</TT> subdirectory will
be placed to <TT>`xemacs/beta'</TT>, as one would expect.

<A NAME="IDX36"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`-P <VAR>prefix</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`--directory-prefix=<VAR>prefix</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>
Set directory prefix to <VAR>prefix</VAR>.  The <EM>directory prefix</EM> is the
directory where all other files and subdirectories will be saved to,
i.e. the top of the retrieval tree.  The default is <SAMP>`.'</SAMP> (the

Specify the username <VAR>user</VAR> and password <VAR>password</VAR> on an
HTTP server.  According to the type of the challenge, Wget will
encode them using either the <CODE>basic</CODE> (insecure) or the
<CODE>digest</CODE> authentication scheme.

Another way to specify username and password is in the URL itself
(See section <A HREF="wget.html#SEC3">URL Format</A>).  For more information about security issues with
Wget, See section <A HREF="wget.html#SEC49">Security Considerations</A>.

<DT><SAMP>`-C on/off'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`--cache=on/off'</SAMP>
<DD>
When set to off, disable server-side cache.  In this case, Wget will
send the remote server an appropriate directive (<SAMP>`Pragma:
no-cache'</SAMP>) to get the file from the remote service, rather than
returning the cached version.  This is especially useful for retrieving
and flushing out-of-date documents on proxy servers.

Caching is allowed by default.

<A NAME="IDX42"></A>
<A NAME="IDX43"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`--ignore-length'</SAMP>
<DD>
Unfortunately, some HTTP servers (CGI programs, to be more
precise) send out bogus <CODE>Content-Length</CODE> headers, which makes Wget
go wild, as it thinks not all the document was retrieved.  You can spot
this syndrome if Wget retries getting the same document again and again,
each time claiming that the (otherwise normal) connection has closed on
the very same byte.

With this option, Wget will ignore the <CODE>Content-Length</CODE> header--as
if it never existed.

<A NAME="IDX44"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`--header=<VAR>additional-header</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>
Define an <VAR>additional-header</VAR> to be passed to the HTTP servers.
Headers must contain a <SAMP>`:'</SAMP> preceded by one or more non-blank
characters, and must not contain newlines.

You may define more than one additional header by specifying
<SAMP>`--header'</SAMP> more than once.

<DT><SAMP>`-U <VAR>agent-string</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`--user-agent=<VAR>agent-string</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>
Identify as <VAR>agent-string</VAR> to the HTTP server.

The HTTP protocol allows the clients to identify themselves using a
<CODE>User-Agent</CODE> header field.  This enables distinguishing the
WWW software, usually for statistical purposes or for tracing of
protocol violations.  Wget normally identifies as
<SAMP>`Wget/<VAR>version</VAR>'</SAMP>, <VAR>version</VAR> being the current version
number of Wget.

However, some sites have been known to impose the policy of tailoring
the output according to the <CODE>User-Agent</CODE>-supplied information.
While conceptually this is not such a bad idea, it has been abused by
servers denying information to clients other than <CODE>Mozilla</CODE> or
Microsoft <CODE>Internet Explorer</CODE>.  This option allows you to change
the <CODE>User-Agent</CODE> line issued by Wget.  Use of this option is
discouraged, unless you really know what you are doing.

<STRONG>NOTE</STRONG> that Netscape Communications Corp. has claimed that false
transmissions of <SAMP>`Mozilla'</SAMP> as the <CODE>User-Agent</CODE> are a copyright

<A NAME="IDX51"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`-g on/off'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`--glob=on/off'</SAMP>
<DD>
Turn FTP globbing on or off.  Globbing means you may use the
shell-like special characters (<EM>wildcards</EM>), like <SAMP>`*'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`?'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`['</SAMP> and <SAMP>`]'</SAMP> to retrieve more than one file from the
same directory at once, like:


<PRE>
wget ftp://gnjilux.cc.fer.hr/*.msg
</PRE>

By default, globbing will be turned on if the URL contains a
globbing character.  This option may be used to turn globbing on or off
permanently.

You may have to quote the URL to protect it from being expanded by
your shell.  Globbing makes Wget look for a directory listing, which is
system-specific.  This is why it currently works only with Unix FTP
servers (and the ones emulating Unix <CODE>ls</CODE> output).

pages through proxy, e.g.:


<PRE>
wget -r -nd --delete-after http://whatever.com/~popular/page/
</PRE>

The <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> option is to retrieve recursively, and <SAMP>`-nd'</SAMP> not to

<A NAME="IDX56"></A>
<A NAME="IDX57"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`-k'</SAMP>

Convert the non-relative links to relative ones locally.  Only the
references to the documents actually downloaded will be converted; the
rest will be left unchanged.

Note that only at the end of the download can Wget know which links have
been downloaded.  Because of that, much of the work done by <SAMP>`-k'</SAMP>
will be performed at the end of the downloads.

<DT><SAMP>`-m'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`--mirror'</SAMP>

Turn on options suitable for mirroring.  This option turns on recursion

GNU Wget is capable of traversing parts of the Web (or a single
HTTP or FTP server), depth-first following links and directory
structure.  This is called <EM>recursive</EM> retrieving, or
<EM>recursion</EM>.

</P>
<P>
With HTTP URLs, Wget retrieves and parses the HTML from
the given URL, documents, retrieving the files the HTML
document was referring to, through markups like <CODE>href</CODE>, or
<CODE>src</CODE>.  If the freshly downloaded file is also of type
<CODE>text/html</CODE>, it will be parsed and followed further.

</P>
<P>
The maximum <EM>depth</EM> to which the retrieval may descend is specified
with the <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> option (the default maximum depth is five layers).
See section <A HREF="wget.html#SEC13">Recursive Retrieval</A>.

</P>
<P>
When retrieving an FTP URL recursively, Wget will retrieve all
the data from the given directory tree (including the subdirectories up
to the specified depth) on the remote server, creating its mirror image
locally.  FTP retrieval is also limited by the <CODE>depth</CODE>
parameter.

</P>
<P>
By default, Wget will create a local directory tree, corresponding to
the one found on the remote server.

</P>
<P>
Recursive retrieving can find a number of applications, the most
important of which is mirroring.  It is also useful for WWW
presentations, and any other opportunities where slow network
connections should be bypassed by storing the files locally.

</P>
<P>
You should be warned that invoking recursion may cause grave overloading
on your system, because of the fast exchange of data through the
network; all of this may hamper other users' work.  The same stands for
the foreign server you are mirroring--the more requests it gets in a
rows, the greater is its load.

</P>
<P>
Careless retrieving can also fill your file system unctrollably, which
can grind the machine to a halt.

</P>
<P>
The load can be minimized by lowering the maximum recursion level
(<SAMP>`-l'</SAMP>) and/or by lowering the number of retries (<SAMP>`-t'</SAMP>).  You
may also consider using the <SAMP>`-w'</SAMP> option to slow down your requests
to the remote servers, as well as the numerous options to narrow the
number of followed links (See section <A HREF="wget.html#SEC14">Following Links</A>).

Recursive retrieval is a good thing when used properly.  Please take all
precautions not to wreak havoc through carelessness.

When retrieving recursively, one does not wish to retrieve the loads of
unnecessary data.  Most of the time the users bear in mind exactly what
they want to download, and want Wget to follow only specific links.

</P>
<P>
For example, if you wish to download the music archive from
<SAMP>`fly.cc.fer.hr'</SAMP>, you will not want to download all the home pages
that happen to be referenced by an obscure part of the archive.

</P>
<P>
Wget possesses several mechanisms that allows you to fine-tune which
links it will follow.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC15" HREF="wget.html#TOC15">Relative Links</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX64"></A>

</P>
<P>
When only relative links are followed (option <SAMP>`-L'</SAMP>), recursive
retrieving will never span hosts.  No time-expensive DNS-lookups
will be performed, and the process will be very fast, with the minimum
strain of the network.  This will suit your needs often, especially when
mirroring the output of various <CODE>x2html</CODE> converters, since they
generally output relative links.

</P>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX65"></A>
<A NAME="IDX66"></A>
<A NAME="IDX67"></A>

</P>
<P>
The drawback of following the relative links solely is that humans often
tend to mix them with absolute links to the very same host, and the very
same page.  In this mode (which is the default mode for following links)
all URLs the that refer to the same host will be retrieved.

</P>
<P>
The problem with this option are the aliases of the hosts and domains.
Thus there is no way for Wget to know that <SAMP>`regoc.srce.hr'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`www.srce.hr'</SAMP> are the same host, or that <SAMP>`fly.cc.fer.hr'</SAMP> is
the same as <SAMP>`fly.cc.etf.hr'</SAMP>.  Whenever an absolute link is
encountered, the host is DNS-looked-up with <CODE>gethostbyname</CODE> to
check whether we are maybe dealing with the same hosts.  Although the
results of <CODE>gethostbyname</CODE> are cached, it is still a great
slowdown, e.g. when dealing with large indices of home pages on different
hosts (because each of the hosts must be and DNS-resolved to see
whether it just <EM>might</EM> an alias of the starting host).

</P>
<P>
To avoid the overhead you may use <SAMP>`-nh'</SAMP>, which will turn off
DNS-resolving and make Wget compare hosts literally.  This will
make things run much faster, but also much less reliable
(e.g. <SAMP>`www.srce.hr'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`regoc.srce.hr'</SAMP> will be flagged as
different hosts).

</P>
<P>
Note that modern HTTP servers allows one IP address to host several
<EM>virtual servers</EM>, each having its own directory hieratchy.  Such
"servers" are distinguished by their hostnames (all of which point to
the same IP address); for this to work, a client must send a <CODE>Host</CODE>
header, which is what Wget does.  However, in that case Wget <EM>must
not</EM> try to divine a host's "real" address, nor try to use the same
hostname for each access, i.e. <SAMP>`-nh'</SAMP> must be turned on.

</P>
<P>
In other words, the <SAMP>`-nh'</SAMP> option must be used to enabling the
retrieval from virtual servers distinguished by their hostnames.  As the
number of such server setups grow, the behavior of <SAMP>`-nh'</SAMP> may become
the default in the future.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC17" HREF="wget.html#TOC17">Domain Acceptance</A></H2>

<P>
With the <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP> option you may specify the domains that will be
followed.  The hosts the domain of which is not in this list will not be
DNS-resolved.  Thus you can specify <SAMP>`-Dmit.edu'</SAMP> just to make
sure that <STRONG>nothing outside of MIT gets looked up</STRONG>.  This is
very important and useful.  It also means that <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP> does <EM>not</EM>
imply <SAMP>`-H'</SAMP> (span all hosts), which must be specified explicitly.
Feel free to use this options since it will speed things up, with almost
all the reliability of checking for all hosts.  Thus you could invoke

wget -r -D.hr http://fly.cc.fer.hr/
</PRE>

<P>
to make sure that only the hosts in <SAMP>`.hr'</SAMP> domain get
DNS-looked-up for being equal to <SAMP>`fly.cc.fer.hr'</SAMP>.  So
<SAMP>`fly.cc.etf.hr'</SAMP> will be checked (only once!) and found equal, but
<SAMP>`www.gnu.ai.mit.edu'</SAMP> will not even be checked.

</P>
<P>
Of course, domain acceptance can be used to limit the retrieval to
particular domains with spanning of hosts in them, but then you must
specify <SAMP>`-H'</SAMP> explicitly.  E.g.:

</P>

<PRE>
wget -r -H -Dmit.edu,stanford.edu http://www.mit.edu/
</PRE>

<P>
will start with <SAMP>`http://www.mit.edu/'</SAMP>, following links across
MIT and Stanford.

</P>
<P>
If there are domains you want to exclude specifically, you can do it
with <SAMP>`--exclude-domains'</SAMP>, which accepts the same type of arguments
of <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP>, but will <EM>exclude</EM> all the listed domains.  For
example, if you want to download all the hosts from <SAMP>`foo.edu'</SAMP>
domain, with the exception of <SAMP>`sunsite.foo.edu'</SAMP>, you can do it like
this:

</P>

<PRE>
wget -rH -Dfoo.edu --exclude-domains sunsite.foo.edu http://www.foo.edu/

When <SAMP>`-H'</SAMP> is specified without <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP>, all hosts are freely
spanned.  There are no restrictions whatsoever as to what part of the
net Wget will go to fetch documents, other than maximum retrieval depth.
If a page references <SAMP>`www.yahoo.com'</SAMP>, so be it.  Such an option is
rarely useful for itself.

When downloading material from the web, you will often want to restrict
the retrieval to only certain file types.  For example, if you are
interested in downloading GIFS, you will not be overjoyed to get
loads of Postscript documents, and vice versa.

</P>
<P>
Wget offers two options to deal with this problem.  Each option
description lists a short name, a long name, and the equivalent command
in <TT>`.wgetrc'</TT>.

<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`--accept <VAR>acclist</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`accept = <VAR>acclist</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>
The argument to <SAMP>`--accept'</SAMP> option is a list of file suffixes or
patterns that Wget will download during recursive retrieval.  A suffix
is the ending part of a file, and consists of "normal" letters,
e.g. <SAMP>`gif'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`.jpg'</SAMP>.  A matching pattern contains shell-like
wildcards, e.g. <SAMP>`books*'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`zelazny*196[0-9]*'</SAMP>.

So, specifying <SAMP>`wget -A gif,jpg'</SAMP> will make Wget download only the
files ending with <SAMP>`gif'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`jpg'</SAMP>, i.e. GIFs and
JPEGs.  On the other hand, <SAMP>`wget -A "zelazny*196[0-9]*"'</SAMP> will
download only files beginning with <SAMP>`zelazny'</SAMP> and containing numbers
from 1960 to 1969 anywhere within.  Look up the manual of your shell for
a description of how pattern matching works.

Of course, any number of suffixes and patterns can be combined into a
comma-separated list, and given as an argument to <SAMP>`-A'</SAMP>.

<DT><SAMP>`--reject <VAR>rejlist</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`reject = <VAR>rejlist</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>
The <SAMP>`--reject'</SAMP> option works the same way as <SAMP>`--accept'</SAMP>, only
its logic is the reverse; Wget will download all files <EM>except</EM> the
ones matching the suffixes (or patterns) in the list.

So, if you want to download a whole page except for the cumbersome
MPEGs and .AU files, you can use <SAMP>`wget -R mpg,mpeg,au'</SAMP>.
Analogously, to download all files except the ones beginning with
<SAMP>`bjork'</SAMP>, use <SAMP>`wget -R "bjork*"'</SAMP>.  The quotes are to prevent
expansion by the shell.
</DL>

<P>
The <SAMP>`-A'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-R'</SAMP> options may be combined to achieve even
better fine-tuning of which files to retrieve.  E.g. <SAMP>`wget -A
"*zelazny*" -R .ps'</SAMP> will download all the files having <SAMP>`zelazny'</SAMP> as
a part of their name, but <EM>not</EM> the postscript files.

</P>
<P>
Note that these two options do not affect the downloading of HTML
files; Wget must load all the HTMLs to know where to go at
all--recursive retrieval would make no sense otherwise.

Regardless of other link-following facilities, it is often useful to
place the restriction of what files to retrieve based on the directories
those files are placed in.  There can be many reasons for this--the
home pages may be organized in a reasonable directory structure; or some
directories may contain useless information, e.g. <TT>`/cgi-bin'</TT> or
<TT>`/dev'</TT> directories.

</P>
<P>
Wget offers three different options to deal with this requirement.  Each
option description lists a short name, a long name, and the equivalent
command in <TT>`.wgetrc'</TT>.

<DD>
<SAMP>`-I'</SAMP> option accepts a comma-separated list of directories included
in the retrieval.  Any other directories will simply be ignored.  The
directories are absolute paths.

So, if you wish to download from <SAMP>`http://host/people/bozo/'</SAMP>
following only links to bozo's colleagues in the <TT>`/people'</TT>
directory and the bogus scripts in <TT>`/cgi-bin'</TT>, you can specify:

<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`exclude_directories = <VAR>list</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>
<SAMP>`-X'</SAMP> option is exactly the reverse of <SAMP>`-I'</SAMP>---this is a list of
directories <EM>excluded</EM> from the download.  E.g. if you do not want
Wget to download things from <TT>`/cgi-bin'</TT> directory, specify <SAMP>`-X
/cgi-bin'</SAMP> on the command line.

The same as with <SAMP>`-A'</SAMP>/<SAMP>`-R'</SAMP>, these two options can be combined
to get a better fine-tuning of downloading subdirectories.  E.g. if you
want to load all the files from <TT>`/pub'</TT> hierarchy except for
<TT>`/pub/worthless'</TT>, specify <SAMP>`-I/pub -X/pub/worthless'</SAMP>.

<DT><SAMP>`--no-parent'</SAMP>

<DD>
The simplest, and often very useful way of limiting directories is
disallowing retrieval of the links that refer to the hierarchy
<EM>upper</EM> than the beginning directory, i.e. disallowing ascent to the
parent directory/directories.

The <SAMP>`--no-parent'</SAMP> option (short <SAMP>`-np'</SAMP>) is useful in this case.
Using it guarantees that you will never leave the existing hierarchy.
Supposing you issue Wget with:


<PRE>
wget -r --no-parent http://somehost/~luzer/my-archive/
</PRE>

You may rest assured that none of the references to
<TT>`/~his-girls-homepage/'</TT> or <TT>`/~luzer/all-my-mpegs/'</TT> will be
followed.  Only the archive you are interested in will be downloaded.
Essentially, <SAMP>`--no-parent'</SAMP> is similar to
<SAMP>`-I/~luzer/my-archive'</SAMP>, only it handles redirections in a more
intelligent fashion.

The rules for FTP are somewhat specific, as it is necessary for
them to be.  FTP links in HTML documents are often included
for purposes of reference, and it is often inconvenient to download them
by default.

</P>
<P>
To have FTP links followed from HTML documents, you need to
specify the <SAMP>`--follow-ftp'</SAMP> option.  Having done that, FTP
links will span hosts regardless of <SAMP>`-H'</SAMP> setting.  This is logical,
as FTP links rarely point to the same host where the HTTP
server resides.  For similar reasons, the <SAMP>`-L'</SAMP> options has no
effect on such downloads.  On the other hand, domain acceptance
(<SAMP>`-D'</SAMP>) and suffix rules (<SAMP>`-A'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-R'</SAMP>) apply normally.

</P>
<P>
Also note that followed links to FTP directories will not be
retrieved recursively further.

<P>
One of the most important aspects of mirroring information from the
Internet is updating your archives.

</P>
<P>
Downloading the whole archive again and again, just to replace a few
changed files is expensive, both in terms of wasted bandwidth and money,
and the time to do the update.  This is why all the mirroring tools
offer the option of incremental updating.

</P>
<P>
Such an updating mechanism means that the remote server is scanned in
search of <EM>new</EM> files.  Only those new files will be downloaded in
the place of the old ones.

</P>
<P>
A file is considered new if one of these two conditions are met:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

A file of that name does not already exist locally.

<LI>

A file of that name does exist, but the remote file was modified more
recently than the local file.
</OL>

<P>
To implement this, the program needs to be aware of the time of last
modification of both remote and local files.  Such information are
called the <EM>time-stamps</EM>.

</P>
<P>
The time-stamping in GNU Wget is turned on using <SAMP>`--timestamping'</SAMP>
(<SAMP>`-N'</SAMP>) option, or through <CODE>timestamping = on</CODE> directive in
<TT>`.wgetrc'</TT>.  With this option, for each file it intends to download,
Wget will check whether a local file of the same name exists.  If it
does, and the remote file is older, Wget will not download it.

</P>
<P>
If the local file does not exist, or the sizes of the files do not
match, Wget will download the remote file no matter what the time-stamps
say.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC23" HREF="wget.html#TOC23">Time-Stamping Usage</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX93"></A>
<A NAME="IDX94"></A>

</P>
<P>
The usage of time-stamping is simple.  Say you would like to download a
file so that it keeps its date of modification.

</P>

<PRE>
wget -S http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/
</PRE>

<P>
A simple <CODE>ls -l</CODE> shows that the time stamp on the local file equals
the state of the <CODE>Last-Modified</CODE> header, as returned by the server.
As you can see, the time-stamping info is preserved locally, even
without <SAMP>`-N'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
Several days later, you would like Wget to check if the remote file has
changed, and download it if it has.

</P>

<PRE>
wget -N http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/
</PRE>

<P>
Wget will ask the server for the last-modified date.  If the local file
is newer, the remote file will not be re-fetched.  However, if the remote
file is more recent, Wget will proceed fetching it normally.

</P>
<P>
The same goes for FTP.  For example:

</P>

<PRE>
wget ftp://ftp.ifi.uio.no/pub/emacs/gnus/*
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>ls</CODE> will show that the timestamps are set according to the state
on the remote server.  Reissuing the command with <SAMP>`-N'</SAMP> will make
Wget re-fetch <EM>only</EM> the files that have been modified.

</P>
<P>
In both HTTP and FTP retrieval Wget will time-stamp the local
file correctly (with or without <SAMP>`-N'</SAMP>) if it gets the stamps,
i.e. gets the directory listing for FTP or the <CODE>Last-Modified</CODE>
header for HTTP.

</P>
<P>
If you wished to mirror the GNU archive every week, you would use the
following command every week:

</P>

<PRE>
wget --timestamping -r ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC24" HREF="wget.html#TOC24">HTTP Time-Stamping Internals</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX95"></A>

</P>
<P>
Time-stamping in HTTP is implemented by checking of the
<CODE>Last-Modified</CODE> header.  If you wish to retrieve the file
<TT>`foo.html'</TT> through HTTP, Wget will check whether
<TT>`foo.html'</TT> exists locally.  If it doesn't, <TT>`foo.html'</TT> will be
retrieved unconditionally.

</P>
<P>
If the file does exist locally, Wget will first check its local
time-stamp (similar to the way <CODE>ls -l</CODE> checks it), and then send a
<CODE>HEAD</CODE> request to the remote server, demanding the information on
the remote file.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>Last-Modified</CODE> header is examined to find which file was
modified more recently (which makes it "newer").  If the remote file
is newer, it will be downloaded; if it is older, Wget will give
up.<A NAME="DOCF2" HREF="wget.html#FOOT2">(2)</A>

</P>
<P>
Arguably, HTTP time-stamping should be implemented using the
<CODE>If-Modified-Since</CODE> request.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC25" HREF="wget.html#TOC25">FTP Time-Stamping Internals</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX96"></A>

</P>
<P>
In theory, FTP time-stamping works much the same as HTTP, only
FTP has no headers--time-stamps must be received from the
directory listings.

</P>
<P>
For each directory files must be retrieved from, Wget will use the
<CODE>LIST</CODE> command to get the listing.  It will try to analyze the
listing, assuming that it is a Unix <CODE>ls -l</CODE> listing, and extract
the time-stamps.  The rest is exactly the same as for HTTP.

</P>
<P>
Assumption that every directory listing is a Unix-style listing may
sound extremely constraining, but in practice it is not, as many
non-Unix FTP servers use the Unixoid listing format because most
(all?) of the clients understand it.  Bear in mind that RFC959
defines no standard way to get a file list, let alone the time-stamps.
We can only hope that a future standard will define this.

</P>
<P>
Another non-standard solution includes the use of <CODE>MDTM</CODE> command
that is supported by some FTP servers (including the popular
<CODE>wu-ftpd</CODE>), which returns the exact time of the specified file.
Wget may support this command in the future.

Once you know how to change default settings of Wget through command
line arguments, you may wish to make some of those settings permanent.
You can do that in a convenient way by creating the Wget startup
file---<TT>`.wgetrc'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
Besides <TT>`.wgetrc'</TT> is the "main" initialization file, it is
convenient to have a special facility for storing passwords.  Thus Wget
reads and interprets the contents of <TT>`$HOME/.netrc'</TT>, if it finds
it.  You can find <TT>`.netrc'</TT> format in your system manuals.

Wget reads <TT>`.wgetrc'</TT> upon startup, recognizing a limited set of

When initializing, Wget will look for a <EM>global</EM> startup file,
<TT>`/usr/local/etc/wgetrc'</TT> by default (or some prefix other than
<TT>`/usr/local'</TT>, if Wget was not installed there) and read commands
from there, if it exists.

</P>
<P>
Then it will look for the user's file.  If the environmental variable
<CODE>WGETRC</CODE> is set, Wget will try to load that file.  Failing that, no
further attempts will be made.

</P>
<P>
If <CODE>WGETRC</CODE> is not set, Wget will try to load <TT>`$HOME/.wgetrc'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
The fact that user's settings are loaded after the system-wide ones
means that in case of collision user's wgetrc <EM>overrides</EM> the

The <EM>variable</EM> will also be called <EM>command</EM>.  Valid

discarded.

### Sample Wget initialization file .wgetrc
###

## You can use this file to change the default behaviour of wget or to
## avoid having to type many many command-line options. This file does
## not contain a comprehensive list of commands -- look at the manual
## to find out what you can put into this file.
## 
## Wget initialization file can reside in /usr/local/etc/wgetrc
## (global, for all users) or $HOME/.wgetrc (for a single user).
##
## To use any of the settings in this file, you will have to uncomment
## them (and probably change them).

##
## Global settings (useful for setting up in /usr/local/etc/wgetrc).
## Think well before you change them, since they may reduce wget's
## functionality, and make it behave contrary to the documentation:
##

# You can set retrieve quota for beginners by specifying a value
# optionally followed by 'K' (kilobytes) or 'M' (megabytes).  The
# default quota is unlimited.
#quota = inf

# You can lower (or raise) the default number of retries when
# downloading a file (default is 20).
#tries = 20

# Lowering the maximum depth of the recursive retrieval is handy to
# prevent newbies from going too "deep" when they unwittingly start
# the recursive retrieval.  The default is 5.
#reclevel = 5

# Many sites are behind firewalls that do not allow initiation of
# connections from the outside.  On these sites you have to use the
# `passive' feature of FTP.  If you are behind such a firewall, you
# can turn this on to make Wget use passive FTP by default.
#passive_ftp = off

##
## Local settings (for a user to set in his $HOME/.wgetrc).  It is
## *highly* undesirable to put these settings in the global file, since
## they are potentially dangerous to "normal" users.
##
## Even when setting up your own ~/.wgetrc, you should know what you
## are doing before doing so.
##

# Set this to on to use timestamping by default:
#timestamping = off

# It is a good idea to make Wget send your email address in a `From:'
# header with your request (so that server administrators can contact
# you in case of errors).  Wget does *not* send `From:' by default.
#header = From: Your Name &#60;username@site.domain&#62;

# You can set up other headers, like Accept-Language.  Accept-Language
# is *not* sent by default.
#header = Accept-Language: en

# You can set the default proxy for Wget to use.  It will override the
# value in the environment.
#http_proxy = http://proxy.yoyodyne.com:18023/

# If you do not want to use proxy at all, set this to off.
#use_proxy = on

# You can customize the retrieval outlook.  Valid options are default,
# binary, mega and micro.
#dot_style = default

# Setting this to off makes Wget not download /robots.txt.  Be sure to
# know *exactly* what /robots.txt is and how it is used before changing
# the default!
#robots = on

# It can be useful to make Wget wait between connections.  Set this to
# the number of seconds you want Wget to wait.
#wait = 0

# You can force creating directory structure, even if a single is being
# retrieved, by setting this to on.
#dirstruct = off

# You can turn on recursive retrieving by default (don't do this if
# you are not sure you know what it means) by setting this to on.
#recursive = off

# To have Wget follow FTP links from HTML files by default, set this
# to on:
#follow_ftp = off

The examples are classified into three sections, because of clarity.

<UL>
<LI>

Say you want to download a URL.  Just type:


<PRE>
wget http://fly.cc.fer.hr/
</PRE>

The response will be something like:


<PRE>
--13:30:45--  http://fly.cc.fer.hr:80/en/
           =&#62; `index.html'
Connecting to fly.cc.fer.hr:80... connected!

<LI>

But what will happen if the connection is slow, and the file is lengthy?
The connection will probably fail before the whole file is retrieved,
more than once.  In this case, Wget will try getting the file until it
either gets the whole of it, or exceeds the default number of retries
(this being 20).  It is easy to change the number of tries to 45, to
insure that the whole file will arrive safely:


<PRE>
wget --tries=45 http://fly.cc.fer.hr/jpg/flyweb.jpg
</PRE>

<LI>

Now let's leave Wget to work in the background, and write its progress
to log file <TT>`log'</TT>.  It is tiring to type <SAMP>`--tries'</SAMP>, so we
shall use <SAMP>`-t'</SAMP>.


<PRE>
wget -t 45 -o log http://fly.cc.fer.hr/jpg/flyweb.jpg &#38;
</PRE>

The ampersand at the end of the line makes sure that Wget works in the
background.  To unlimit the number of retries, use <SAMP>`-t inf'</SAMP>.

<LI>

The usage of FTP is as simple.  Wget will take care of login and
password.


<PRE>
$ wget ftp://gnjilux.cc.fer.hr/welcome.msg
--10:08:47--  ftp://gnjilux.cc.fer.hr:21/welcome.msg

If you specify a directory, Wget will retrieve the directory listing,
parse it and convert it to HTML.  Try:


<PRE>
wget ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/
lynx index.html

You would like to read the list of URLs from a file?  Not a problem
with that:


<PRE>
wget -i file
</PRE>

If you specify <SAMP>`-'</SAMP> as file name, the URLs will be read from
standard input.

Create a mirror image of GNU WWW site (with the same directory structure
the original has) with only one try per document, saving the log of the
activities to <TT>`gnulog'</TT>:


<PRE>
wget -r -t1 http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/ -o gnulog
</PRE>

<LI>

Retrieve the first layer of yahoo links:


<PRE>
wget -r -l1 http://www.yahoo.com/
</PRE>

Retrieve the index.html of <SAMP>`www.lycos.com'</SAMP>, showing the original
server headers:


<PRE>
wget -S http://www.lycos.com/
</PRE>

<LI>

Save the server headers with the file:

<PRE>
wget -s http://www.lycos.com/

Retrieve the first two levels of <SAMP>`wuarchive.wustl.edu'</SAMP>, saving them
to /tmp.


<PRE>
wget -P/tmp -l2 ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/
</PRE>

<LI>

You want to download all the GIFs from an HTTP directory.
<SAMP>`wget http://host/dir/*.gif'</SAMP> doesn't work, since HTTP
retrieval does not support globbing.  In that case, use:


<PRE>
wget -r -l1 --no-parent -A.gif http://host/dir/
</PRE>

It is a bit of a kludge, but it works.  <SAMP>`-r -l1'</SAMP> means to retrieve
recursively (See section <A HREF="wget.html#SEC13">Recursive Retrieval</A>), with maximum depth of 1.
<SAMP>`--no-parent'</SAMP> means that references to the parent directory are
ignored (See section <A HREF="wget.html#SEC20">Directory-Based Limits</A>), and <SAMP>`-A.gif'</SAMP> means to
download only the GIF files.  <SAMP>`-A "*.gif"'</SAMP> would have worked
too.

<LI>

Suppose you were in the middle of downloading, when Wget was
interrupted.  Now you do not want to clobber the files already present.
It would be:


<PRE>
wget -nc -r http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/
</PRE>

<LI>

If you want to encode your own username and password to HTTP or
FTP, use the appropriate URL syntax (See section <A HREF="wget.html#SEC3">URL Format</A>).


<PRE>
wget ftp://hniksic:mypassword@jagor.srce.hr/.emacs
</PRE>

<LI>

If you do not like the default retrieval visualization (1K dots with 10
dots per cluster and 50 dots per line), you can customize it through dot
settings (See section <A HREF="wget.html#SEC29">Wgetrc Commands</A>).  For example, many people like the
"binary" style of retrieval, with 8K dots and 512K lines:


<PRE>
wget --dot-style=binary ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/README
</PRE>

You can experiment with other styles, like:


<PRE>
wget --dot-style=mega ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/xemacs-20.4/xemacs-20.4.tar.gz
wget --dot-style=micro http://fly.cc.fer.hr/
</PRE>

To make these settings permanent, put them in your <TT>`.wgetrc'</TT>, as
described before (See section <A HREF="wget.html#SEC30">Sample Wgetrc</A>).

If you wish Wget to keep a mirror of a page (or FTP
subdirectories), use <SAMP>`--mirror'</SAMP> (<SAMP>`-m'</SAMP>), which is the shorthand
for <SAMP>`-r -N'</SAMP>.  You can put Wget in the crontab file asking it to
recheck a site each Sunday:


<PRE>
crontab
0 0 * * 0 wget --mirror ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/ -o /home/me/weeklog
</PRE>

<LI>

You may wish to do the same with someone's home page.  But you do not
want to download all those images--you're only interested in HTML.


<PRE>
wget --mirror -A.html http://www.w3.org/
</PRE>

<LI>

But what about mirroring the hosts networkologically close to you?  It
seems so awfully slow because of all that DNS resolving.  Just use
<SAMP>`-D'</SAMP> (See section <A HREF="wget.html#SEC17">Domain Acceptance</A>).


<PRE>
wget -rN -Dsrce.hr http://www.srce.hr/
</PRE>

Now Wget will correctly find out that <SAMP>`regoc.srce.hr'</SAMP> is the same
as <SAMP>`www.srce.hr'</SAMP>, but will not even take into consideration the
link to <SAMP>`www.mit.edu'</SAMP>.

<LI>

You have a presentation and would like the dumb absolute links to be
converted to relative?  Use <SAMP>`-k'</SAMP>:


<PRE>
wget -k -r <VAR>URL</VAR>
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX110"></A>
<LI>

You would like the output documents to go to standard output instead of
to files?  OK, but Wget will automatically shut up (turn on
<SAMP>`--quiet'</SAMP>) to prevent mixing of Wget output and the retrieved
documents.


<PRE>
wget -O - http://jagor.srce.hr/ http://www.srce.hr/
</PRE>

You can also combine the two options and make weird pipelines to
retrieve the documents from remote hotlists:


<PRE>
wget -O - http://cool.list.com/ | wget --force-html -i -
</PRE>

<H2><A NAME="SEC36" HREF="wget.html#TOC36">Proxies</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX112"></A>

</P>
<P>
<EM>Proxies</EM> are special-purpose HTTP servers designed to transfer
data from remote servers to local clients.  One typical use of proxies
is lightening network load for users behind a slow connection.  This is
achieved by channeling all HTTP and FTP requests through the
proxy which caches the transferred data.  When a cached resource is
requested again, proxy will return the data from cache.  Another use for
proxies is for companies that separate (for security reasons) their
internal networks from the rest of Internet.  In order to obtain
information from the Web, their users connect and retrieve remote data
using an authorized proxy.

</P>
<P>
Wget supports proxies for both HTTP and FTP retrievals.  The
standard way to specify proxy location, which Wget recognizes, is using
the following environment variables:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>http_proxy</CODE>
<DD>
This variable should contain the URL of the proxy for HTTP
connections.

<DT><CODE>ftp_proxy</CODE>
<DD>
This variable should contain the URL of the proxy for HTTP
connections.  It is quite common that HTTP_PROXY and FTP_PROXY 
are set to the same URL.

<DT><CODE>no_proxy</CODE>
<DD>
This variable should contain a comma-separated list of domain extensions 
proxy should <EM>not</EM> be used for.  For instance, if the value of
<CODE>no_proxy</CODE> is <SAMP>`.mit.edu'</SAMP>, proxy will not be used to retrieve
documents from MIT.
</DL>

<P>
In addition to the environment variables, proxy location and settings
may be specified from within Wget itself.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><SAMP>`-Y on/off'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`--proxy=on/off'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`proxy = on/off'</SAMP>
<DD>
This option may be used to turn the proxy support on or off.  Proxy
support is on by default, provided that the appropriate environment
variables are set.

<DT><SAMP>`http_proxy = <VAR>URL</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`ftp_proxy = <VAR>URL</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`no_proxy = <VAR>string</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>
These startup file variables allow you to override the proxy settings
specified by the environment.
</DL>

<P>
Some proxy servers require authorization to enable you to use them.  The
authorization consists of <EM>username</EM> and <EM>password</EM>, which must
be sent by Wget.  As with HTTP authorization, several
authentication schemes exist.  For proxy authorization only the
<CODE>Basic</CODE> authentication scheme is currently implemented.

</P>
<P>
You may specify your username and password either through the proxy
URL or through the command-line options.  Assuming that the
company's proxy is located at <SAMP>`proxy.srce.hr'</SAMP> at port 8001, a proxy
URL location containing authorization data might look like this:

</P>

<PRE>
http://hniksic:mypassword@proxy.company.com:8001/
</PRE>

<P>
Alternatively, you may use the <SAMP>`proxy-user'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`proxy-password'</SAMP> options, and the equivalent <TT>`.wgetrc'</TT>
settings <CODE>proxy_user</CODE> and <CODE>proxy_passwd</CODE> to set the proxy
username and password.

<A HREF="mailto:bug-wget@gnu.org">bug-wget@gnu.org</A>.  The bugs that you think are of the
interest to the public (i.e. more people should be informed about them)
can be Cc-ed to the mailing list at <A HREF="mailto:wget@sunsite.auc.dk">wget@sunsite.auc.dk</A>.

</P>
<P>
Before actually submitting a bug report, please try to follow a few
simple guidelines.

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Please try to ascertain that the behaviour you see really is a bug.  If
Wget crashes, it's a bug.  If Wget does not behave as documented,
it's a bug.  If things work strange, but you are not sure about the way
they are supposed to work, it might well be a bug.

<LI>

Try to repeat the bug in as simple circumstances as possible.  E.g. if
Wget crashes on <SAMP>`wget -rLl0 -t5 -Y0 http://yoyodyne.com -o
/tmp/log'</SAMP>, you should try to see if it will crash with a simpler set of
options.

Also, while I will probably be interested to know the contents of your
<TT>`.wgetrc'</TT> file, just dumping it into the debug message is probably
a bad idea.  Instead, you should first try to see if the bug repeats
with <TT>`.wgetrc'</TT> moved out of the way.  Only if it turns out that
<TT>`.wgetrc'</TT> settings affect the bug, should you mail me the relevant
parts of the file.

<LI>

Please start Wget with <SAMP>`-d'</SAMP> option and send the log (or the
relevant parts of it).  If Wget was compiled without debug support,
recompile it.  It is <EM>much</EM> easier to trace bugs with debug support
on.

<LI>

If Wget has crashed, try to run it in a debugger, e.g. <CODE>gdb `which
wget` core</CODE> and type <CODE>where</CODE> to get the backtrace.

<LI>

Find where the bug is, fix it and send me the patches. :-)

Since Wget uses GNU Autoconf for building and configuring, and avoids
using "special" ultra--mega--cool features of any particular Unix, it
should compile (and work) on all common Unix flavors.

</P>
<P>
Various Wget versions have been compiled and tested under many kinds of
Unix systems, including Solaris, Linux, SunOS, OSF (aka Digital Unix),
Ultrix, *BSD, IRIX, and others; refer to the file <TT>`MACHINES'</TT> in the
distribution directory for a comprehensive list.  If you compile it on
an architecture not listed there, please let me know so I can update it.

</P>
<P>
Wget should also compile on the other Unix systems, not listed in
<TT>`MACHINES'</TT>.  If it doesn't, please let me know.

</P>
<P>
Thanks to kind contributors, this version of Wget compiles and works on
Microsoft Windows 95 and Windows NT platforms.  It has been compiled
successfully using MS Visual C++ 4.0, Watcom, and Borland C compilers,
with Winsock as networking software.  Naturally, it is crippled of some
features available on Unix, but it should work as a substitute for
people stuck with Windows.  Note that the Windows port is
<STRONG>neither tested nor maintained</STRONG> by me--all questions and
problems should be reported to Wget mailing list at
<A HREF="mailto:wget@sunsite.auc.dk">wget@sunsite.auc.dk</A> where the maintainers will look at them.

<P>
Since the purpose of Wget is background work, it catches the hangup
signal (<CODE>SIGHUP</CODE>) and ignores it.  If the output was on standard
output, it will be redirected to a file named <TT>`wget-log'</TT>.
Otherwise, <CODE>SIGHUP</CODE> is ignored.  This is convenient when you wish
to redirect the output of Wget after having started it.

$ wget http://www.ifi.uio.no/~larsi/gnus.tar.gz &#38;
$ kill -HUP %%     # Redirect the output to wget-log
</PRE>

<P>
Other than that, Wget will not try to interfere with signals in any
way. <KBD>C-c</KBD>, <CODE>kill -TERM</CODE> and <CODE>kill -KILL</CODE> should kill it
alike.

Since Wget is able to traverse the web, it counts as one of the Web
<EM>robots</EM>.  Thus Wget understands <EM>Robots Exclusion Standard</EM>
(RES)---contents of <TT>`/robots.txt'</TT>, used by server
administrators to shield parts of their systems from wanderings of Wget.

</P>
<P>
Norobots support is turned on only when retrieving recursively, and
<EM>never</EM> for the first page.  Thus, you may issue:

</P>

<PRE>
wget -r http://fly.cc.fer.hr/
</PRE>

<P>
First the index of fly.cc.fer.hr will be downloaded.  If Wget finds
anything worth downloading on the same host, only <EM>then</EM> will it
load the robots, and decide whether or not to load the links after all.
<TT>`/robots.txt'</TT> is loaded only once per host.  Wget does not support
the robots <CODE>META</CODE> tag.

</P>
<P>
The description of the norobots standard was written, and is maintained
by Martijn Koster <A HREF="mailto:m.koster@webcrawler.com">m.koster@webcrawler.com</A>.  With his
permission, I contribute a (slightly modified) texified version of the
RES.

<EM>WWW Robots</EM> (also called <EM>wanderers</EM> or <EM>spiders</EM>) are
programs that traverse many pages in the World Wide Web by recursively
retrieving linked pages. For more information see the robots page.

</P>
<P>
In 1993 and 1994 there have been occasions where robots have visited
WWW servers where they weren't welcome for various
reasons. Sometimes these reasons were robot specific, e.g. certain
robots swamped servers with rapid-fire requests, or retrieved the same
files repeatedly. In other situations robots traversed parts of WWW
servers that weren't suitable, e.g. very deep virtual trees, duplicated
information, temporary information, or cgi-scripts with side-effects
(such as voting).

</P>
<P>
These incidents indicated the need for established mechanisms for
WWW servers to indicate to robots which parts of their server
should not be accessed. This standard addresses this need with an
operational solution.

</P>
<P>
This document represents a consensus on 30 June 1994 on the robots
mailing list (<CODE>robots@webcrawler.com</CODE>), between the majority of
robot authors and other people with an interest in robots. It has also
been open for discussion on the Technical World Wide Web mailing list
(<CODE>www-talk@info.cern.ch</CODE>). This document is based on a previous
working draft under the same title.

</P>
<P>
It is not an official standard backed by a standards body, or owned by
any commercial organization. It is not enforced by anybody, and there
no guarantee that all current and future robots will use it. Consider
it a common facility the majority of robot authors offer the WWW
community to protect WWW server against unwanted accesses by their
robots.

<A NAME="IDX127"></A>

</P>
<P>
The format and semantics of the <TT>`/robots.txt'</TT> file are as follows:

</P>
<P>
The file consists of one or more records separated by one or more blank
lines (terminated by <CODE>CR</CODE>, <CODE>CR/NL</CODE>, or <CODE>NL</CODE>).  Each
record contains lines of the form:

</P>

<PRE>
&#60;field&#62;:&#60;optionalspace&#62;&#60;value&#62;&#60;optionalspace&#62;
</PRE>

<P>
The field name is case insensitive.
   
Comments can be included in file using UNIX bourne shell conventions:
the <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> character is used to indicate that preceding space (if any)
and the remainder of the line up to the line termination is discarded.
Lines containing only a comment are discarded completely, and therefore
do not indicate a record boundary.

</P>
<P>
The record starts with one or more User-agent lines, followed by one or
more Disallow lines, as detailed below. Unrecognized headers are
ignored.

</P>
<P>
The presence of an empty <TT>`/robots.txt'</TT> file has no explicit
associated semantics, it will be treated as if it was not present,
i.e. all robots will consider themselves welcome.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC46" HREF="wget.html#TOC46">User-Agent Field</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX128"></A>

</P>
<P>
The value of this field is the name of the robot the record is
describing access policy for.

</P>
<P>
If more than one User-agent field is present the record describes an
identical access policy for more than one robot.  At least one field
needs to be present per record.

</P>
<P>
The robot should be liberal in interpreting this field. A case
insensitive substring match of the name without version information is
recommended.

</P>
<P>
If the value is <SAMP>`*'</SAMP>, the record describes the default access policy
for any robot that has not matched any of the other records. It is not
allowed to have multiple such records in the <TT>`/robots.txt'</TT> file.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC47" HREF="wget.html#TOC47">Disallow Field</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX129"></A>

</P>
<P>
The value of this field specifies a partial URL that is not to be
visited. This can be a full path, or a partial path; any URL that
starts with this value will not be retrieved. For example,
<SAMP>`Disallow: /help'</SAMP> disallows both <SAMP>`/help.html'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`/help/index.html'</SAMP>, whereas <SAMP>`Disallow: /help/'</SAMP> would
disallow <SAMP>`/help/index.html'</SAMP> but allow <SAMP>`/help.html'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
Any empty value, indicates that all URLs can be retrieved. At least
one Disallow field needs to be present in a record.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC48" HREF="wget.html#TOC48">Norobots Examples</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX130"></A>

<P>
The following example <SAMP>`/robots.txt'</SAMP> file specifies that no robots
should visit any URL starting with <SAMP>`/cyberworld/map/'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`/tmp/'</SAMP>:

</P>

<PRE>
# robots.txt for http://www.site.com/

User-agent: *
Disallow: /cyberworld/map/ # This is an infinite virtual URL space
Disallow: /tmp/ # these will soon disappear
</PRE>

<P>
This example <SAMP>`/robots.txt'</SAMP> file specifies that no robots should
visit any URL starting with <SAMP>`/cyberworld/map/'</SAMP>, except the
robot called <SAMP>`cybermapper'</SAMP>:

</P>

<PRE>
# robots.txt for http://www.site.com/

User-agent: *
Disallow: /cyberworld/map/ # This is an infinite virtual URL space

# Cybermapper knows where to go.
User-agent: cybermapper
Disallow:

<P>
When using Wget, you must be aware that it sends unencrypted passwords
through the network, which may present a security problem.  Here are the
main issues, and some solutions.

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

The passwords on the command line are visible using <CODE>ps</CODE>.  If this
is a problem, avoid putting passwords from the command line--e.g. you
can use <TT>`.netrc'</TT> for this.

<LI>

Using the insecure <EM>basic</EM> authentication scheme, unencrypted
passwords are transmitted through the network routers and gateways.

<LI>

The FTP passwords are also in no way encrypted.  There is no good
solution for this at the moment.

<LI>

Although the "normal" output of Wget tries to hide the passwords,
debugging logs show them, in all forms.  This problem is avoided by
being careful when you send debug logs (yes, even when you send them to
me).

</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC52" HREF="wget.html#TOC52">Preamble</A></H2>

<P>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

</P>
<P>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

</P>
<P>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

</P>
<P>
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

</P>
<P>
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

</P>
<P>
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

</P>
<P>
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

</P>
<P>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC53" HREF="wget.html#TOC53">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</A></H2>


<OL>
<LI>

This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

<LI>

You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

<LI>

You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:


<OL>
<LI>

You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

<LI>

You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
parties under the terms of this License.

<LI>

If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
</OL>

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

<LI>

You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:


<OL>
<LI>

Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

<LI>

Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,

<LI>

Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with such
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
</OL>

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

<LI>

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

<LI>

You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

<LI>

Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

<LI>

If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

<LI>

If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

<LI>

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

<LI>

If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF

TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

<LI>

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

<H2><A NAME="SEC54" HREF="wget.html#TOC54">How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</A></H2>

<P>
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

</P>
<P>
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

</P>

<PRE>
<VAR>one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.</VAR>

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License

<P>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details

to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'

<P>
The hypothetical commands <SAMP>`show w'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`show c'</SAMP> should show
the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than <SAMP>`show w'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`show c'</SAMP>; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever
suits your program.

</P>
<P>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

</P>

<P>
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.
