<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 About this FAQ </A></H2>

<P>This FAQ is maintained by Vic Metcalfe 
(
<A HREF="mailto:vic@acm.org">vic@acm.org</A>), with lots of
assistance from Andrew Gierth 
(
<A HREF="mailto:andrew@erlenstar.demon.co.uk">andrew@erlenstar.demon.co.uk</A>).
I am depending on the true
wizards to fill in the details, and correct my (no doubt) plentiful
mistakes.  The code examples in this FAQ are written to be easy to follow
and understand.  It is up to the reader to make them as efficient as
required.  I started this faq because after reading comp.unix.programmer 
for a short time, it became evident that a FAQ for sockets was needed.  </P>
<P>The FAQ is available at the following locations:</P>

<P>Please 
<A HREF="mailto:vic@acm.org">email me</A>
if you would like to correct or clarify an answer.  I 
would also like to hear from you if you would like me to add a question 
to the list.  I may not be able to answer it, but I can add it in the 
hopes that someone else will submit an answer.  Every hour I seem to be 
getting even busier, so if I am slow to respond to your email, please be 
patient.  If more than a week passes you may want to send me another one 
as I often put messages aside for later and then forget about them.  I'll 
have to work on dealing with my mail better, but until then feel free to 
pester me a little bit.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 Who is this FAQ for?</A></H2>

<P>This FAQ is for C programmers in the Unix environment.  It is not intended
for WinSock programmers, or for Perl, Java, etc.  I have nothing against
Windows or Perl, but I had to limit the scope of the FAQ for the first
draft.  In the future, I would really like to provide examples for Perl,
Java, and maybe others.  For now though I will concentrate on correctness 
and completeness for C. </P>
<P>This version of the FAQ will only cover sockets of the AF_INET family,
since this is their most common use.  Coverage of other types of sockets
may be added later. </P>


<H2><A NAME="ss1.4">1.4 What are Sockets?</A></H2>

<P>Sockets are just like "worm holes" in science fiction.  When things go
into one end, they (should) come out of the other.  Different kinds of
sockets have different properties.  Sockets are either connection-oriented
or connectionless.  Connection-oriented sockets allow for data to flow
back and forth as needed, while connectionless sockets (also known as
datagram sockets) allow only one message at a time to be transmitted,
without an open connection.  There are also different socket families. 
The two most common are <CODE>AF_INET</CODE> for internet connections, and 
<CODE>AF_UNIX</CODE> for
unix IPC (interprocess communication).  As stated earlier, this FAQ deals
only with <CODE>AF_INET</CODE> sockets. </P>


<H2><A NAME="ss1.5">1.5 How do Sockets Work?</A></H2>

<P>The implementation is left up to the vendor of your particular unix, but
from the point of view of the programmer, connection-oriented sockets work
a lot like files, or pipes.  The most noticeable difference, once you have 
your file descriptor is that <CODE>read()</CODE> or <CODE>write()</CODE> calls may actually 
read or 
write fewer bytes than requested.  If this happens, then you will have to 
make a second call for the rest of the data.  There are examples of this 
in the 
<A HREF="http://www.ibrado.com/sock-faq/examples.tar.gz">source code that accompanies the faq</A>.</P>


<H2><A NAME="books"></A> <A NAME="ss1.6">1.6 Where can I get source code for the book [book title]?</A></H2>

<P>Here is a list of the places I know to get source code for network
programming books.  It is very short, so please mail me with any others
you know of. </P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.7">1.7 Where can I get more information?</A></H2>

<P>I keep a copy of the resources I know of on my socks page on the web.  I 
don't remember where I got most of these items, but some day I'll check 
out their sources, and provide ftp information here.  For now, you can 
get them at
